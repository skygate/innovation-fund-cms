    "9Needs is using blockchain technology to improve Early Childhood Development (ECD) services in South Africa.. Using blockchain infrastructure and smart contracts, 9Needs has prototyped a system that will help strengthen the current registration, contracting, information and management systems. With investment from the Innovation Fund, 9Needs will carry out a field test as well as add additional features to their technology.\n Over the 12-month investment period, 9Needs aims to enroll 50 ECD centres to actively use the platform, which will include using online digital registries to record identities of child beneficiaries and service providers. Blockchain will be used to record data exchange transactions and service attendance, and issuing and redeeming of vouchers will be done digitally.\n The real-time data visualised here shows the number of commits made over time during the development phase of the digital identity viewer used by ECD centres to register children.\n",
