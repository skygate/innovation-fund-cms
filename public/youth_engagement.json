The Maldives face challenges related to training and further development of teachers' skills. UNICEF Maldives is piloting an e-learning platform based on open source Moodle platform to deliver large volumes of content to educators across the country. The development of the platform is currently being finalized based on user feedback that indicate teachers to be open to e-learning tools. Course content is being developed with the National Institute of Education. The platform is expected to go live in July 2017.\r\n\r\nWhen this e-learning platform is established, it will reach approximately 4,000 teachers across 200 islands, serving 220 schools. This will be translated into enhanced quality of teaching, which will lead to better learning outcomes in students.  ",

The Learning Management System and Learning App are designed to run on low-power devices, targeting the needs of learners and teachers in contexts with limited infrastructure. A user can install Kolibri and use the app on a local network without Internet connection, as well as create and share content with others.\r\n \r\nUser testing was done in Uganda among 14-16 year old school children to test the functionalities of the platform. Over 100 pieces of digital  content have been curated to match the Ugandan school curriculum. Kolibri will be piloted initially in 10 schools from February 2017 onwards, and rolled out to 100+ schools from May 2017 onwards with support from UNICEF.\r\n\r\nThe real-time data visualised here shows the number of commits made over time on GitHub during the development of the Kolibri platform.",

The Innovation Fund is investing in a new solution to simplify and convert the paper based inspection to a digital form by using a tablet and Open Data Kit software.

For example, real-time data indicates that school pupils would not take HIV test at school even if the service was provided. This points towards the need of further adapting services (health, social participation) to youth and adolescent needs. Another poll on female genital mutilation indicates that social norms are present among young people and some of the youth are willing to perpetuate that practice.
